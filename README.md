# Flask-MongoDB Kubernetes Deployment

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to deploy a Flask application that interacts with MongoDB on a Minikube Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

- Minikube installed
- kubectl installed
- Docker installed
- Docker Hub account

## Steps

### 1. Start Minikube

Start Minikube with the necessary resources:

```bash
minikube start --cpus=4 --memory=8192
kubectl apply -f mongodb-statefulset.yaml
kubectl apply -f flask-app-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f flask-app-hpa.yaml
minikube service flask-app-service
kubectl get hpa flask-app-hpa --watch
```
### 5. **Explanation of DNS Resolution in Kubernetes**

Kubernetes uses CoreDNS for DNS-based service discovery, allowing services to communicate using their service names. When a pod in the Flask app deployment tries to connect to MongoDB, it can simply use the DNS name `mongodb-service` (defined in the service) to resolve the IP address of the MongoDB pod. This DNS resolution facilitates easy and reliable inter-pod communication within the Kubernetes cluster.

### 6. **Explanation of Resource Requests and Limits**

- **Resource Requests**: The minimum amount of resources (CPU and memory) guaranteed to a container.
- **Resource Limits**: The maximum amount of resources a container is allowed to consume.

Setting appropriate resource requests and limits helps to ensure that critical applications have the resources they need while preventing a single container from monopolizing resources, which could destabilize the cluster.

### 7. **Design Choices**

- **StatefulSet for MongoDB**: Provides stable network identifiers, persistent storage, and ordered scaling for the MongoDB instance. Alternatives like Deployments could be used, but they donâ€™t guarantee stable network IDs, which are crucial for stateful services like databases.
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**: Chosen to ensure the Flask application can handle traffic spikes. An alternative could be manual scaling, but HPA offers more flexibility and responsiveness to real-time traffic.

### 8. **Cookie Point: Testing Scenarios**

#### **Autoscaling Testing**

To test autoscaling, simulate high CPU load:

```bash
for i in {1..1000}; do curl http://$(minikube service flask-app-service --url)/; done
```
